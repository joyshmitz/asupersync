//! Actor abstraction for region-owned, message-driven concurrency.
//!
//! Actors in Asupersync are region-owned tasks that process messages from a
//! bounded mailbox. They integrate with the runtime's structured concurrency
//! model:
//!
//! - **Region-owned**: Actors are spawned within a region and cannot outlive it.
//! - **Cancel-safe mailbox**: Messages use the two-phase reserve/send pattern.
//! - **Lifecycle hooks**: `on_start` and `on_stop` for initialization and cleanup.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! struct Counter {
//!     count: u64,
//! }
//!
//! impl Actor for Counter {
//!     type Message = u64;
//!
//!     async fn handle(&mut self, _cx: &Cx, msg: u64) {
//!         self.count += msg;
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // In a scope:
//! let (handle, stored) = scope.spawn_actor(
//!     &mut state, &cx, Counter { count: 0 }, 32,
//! )?;
//! state.store_spawned_task(handle.task_id(), stored);
//!
//! // Send messages:
//! handle.send(&cx, 5).await?;
//! handle.send(&cx, 10).await?;
//!
//! // Stop the actor:
//! handle.stop();
//! let result = handle.join(&cx).await?;
//! assert_eq!(result.count, 15);
//! ```
