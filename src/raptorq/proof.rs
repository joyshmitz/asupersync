//! RaptorQ decode proof artifact for explainable failures.
//!
//! This module provides a compact, deterministic artifact that explains
//! how a decode operation proceeded and why it succeeded or failed.
//!
//! # Design Goals
//!
//! 1. **Deterministic**: Same inputs produce identical artifacts
//! 2. **Bounded size**: Explicit caps on unbounded collections
//! 3. **Explainable**: Human-readable failure reasons
//! 4. **Replayable**: Sufficient info to reproduce decoder state transitions
