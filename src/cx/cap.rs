//! Typed capability sets for `Cx`.
//!
//! The capability set is represented at the type level so that operations
//! requiring certain effects (spawn/time/random/io/remote) can be gated
//! at compile time.
//!
//! # Forging Prevention
//!
//! Capability marker traits are sealed to prevent external crates from
//! implementing them for arbitrary types. This ensures only the runtime's
//! `CapSet` types can grant access to gated APIs.
//!
//! # Trusted Roots
//!
//! - The runtime constructs full contexts internally (e.g., via `RuntimeState`).
//! - Test-only constructors (e.g., `Cx::for_testing*`) are permitted for harnesses.
