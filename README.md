## TL;DR

**The Problem**: Rust's async ecosystem gives you *tools* but not *guarantees*. Cancellation silently drops data. Spawned tasks can orphan. Cleanup is best-effort. Testing concurrent code is non-deterministic. You write correct code by convention, and discover bugs in production.

**The Solution**: Asupersync is an async runtime where **correctness is structural, not conventional**. Tasks are owned by regions that close to quiescence. Cancellation is a protocol with bounded cleanup. Effects require capabilities. The lab runtime makes concurrency deterministic and replayable.

### Why Asupersync?

| Guarantee | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **No orphan tasks** | Every spawned task is owned by a region; region close waits for all children |
| **Cancel-correctness** | Cancellation is request → drain → finalize, never silent data loss |
| **Bounded cleanup** | Cleanup budgets are *sufficient conditions*, not hopes |
| **No silent drops** | Two-phase effects (reserve/commit) make data loss impossible for primitives |
| **Deterministic testing** | Lab runtime: virtual time, deterministic scheduling, trace replay |
| **Capability security** | All effects flow through explicit `Cx`; no ambient authority |

---

## Quick Example

```rust
use asupersync::{Cx, Scope, Outcome, Budget};

// Structured concurrency: scope guarantees quiescence
async fn main_task(cx: &mut Cx) -> Outcome<(), Error> {
    cx.region(|scope| async {
        // Spawn owned tasks - they cannot orphan
        scope.spawn(worker_a);
        scope.spawn(worker_b);

        // When scope exits: waits for BOTH tasks,
        // runs finalizers, resolves obligations
    }).await;

    // Guaranteed: nothing from inside is still running
    Outcome::ok(())
}

// Cancellation is a protocol, not a flag
async fn worker_a(cx: &mut Cx) -> Outcome<(), Error> {
    loop {
        // Checkpoint for cancellation - explicit, not implicit
        cx.checkpoint()?;

        // Two-phase send: cancel-safe
        let permit = tx.reserve(cx).await?;  // Can cancel here
        permit.send(message);                 // Linear: must happen
    }
}

// Lab runtime: deterministic testing
#[test]
fn test_cancellation_is_bounded() {
    let lab = LabRuntime::new(LabConfig::default().seed(42));

    lab.run(|cx| async {
        // Same seed = same execution = reproducible bugs
        cx.region(|scope| async {
            scope.spawn(task_under_test);
        }).await
    });

    // Oracles verify invariants
    assert!(lab.obligation_leak_oracle().is_ok());
    assert!(lab.quiescence_oracle().is_ok());
}
```

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Structured Concurrency by Construction

Tasks don't float free. Every task is owned by a region. Regions form a tree. When a region closes, it *guarantees* all children are complete, all finalizers have run, all obligations are resolved. This is the "no orphans" invariant, enforced by the type system and runtime rather than by discipline.

```rust
// Typical executors: what happens when this scope exits?
spawn(async { /* orphaned? cancelled? who knows */ });

// Asupersync: scope guarantees quiescence
scope.region(|sub| async {
    sub.spawn(task_a);
    sub.spawn(task_b);
}).await;
// ← guaranteed: nothing from inside is still running
```

### 2. Cancellation as a First-Class Protocol

Cancellation operates as a multi-phase protocol, not a silent `drop`:

```
Running → CancelRequested → Cancelling → Finalizing → Completed(Cancelled)
            ↓                    ↓             ↓
         (bounded)          (cleanup)    (finalizers)
```

- **Request**: propagates down the tree
- **Drain**: tasks run to cleanup points (bounded by budgets)
- **Finalize**: finalizers run (masked, budgeted)
- **Complete**: outcome is `Cancelled(reason)`

Primitives publish *cancellation responsiveness bounds*. Budgets are sufficient conditions for completion.

### 3. Two-Phase Effects Prevent Data Loss

Anywhere cancellation could lose data, Asupersync uses reserve/commit:

```rust
let permit = tx.reserve(cx).await?;  // ← cancel-safe: nothing committed yet
permit.send(message);                 // ← linear: must happen or abort
```

Dropping a permit aborts cleanly. Message never partially sent.

### 4. Capability Security (No Ambient Authority)

All effects flow through explicit capability tokens:

```rust
async fn my_task(cx: &mut Cx) {
    cx.spawn(...);        // ← need spawn capability
    cx.sleep_until(...);  // ← need time capability
    cx.trace(...);        // ← need trace capability
}
```

Swap `Cx` to change interpretation: production vs. lab vs. distributed.

### 5. Deterministic Testing is Default

The lab runtime provides:
- **Virtual time**: sleeps complete instantly, time is controlled
- **Deterministic scheduling**: same seed → same execution
- **Trace capture/replay**: debug production issues locally
- **Schedule exploration**: DPOR-class coverage of interleavings

Concurrency bugs become reproducible test failures.

## "Alien Artifact" Quality Algorithms

Asupersync deliberately uses mathematically rigorous machinery where it buys real correctness, determinism, and debuggability. The intent is to make concurrency properties *structural*, so both humans and coding agents can trust the system under cancellation, failures, and schedule perturbations.

### Formal Semantics (and a Lean Skeleton) for the Runtime Kernel

The runtime design is backed by a small-step operational semantics (`asupersync_v4_formal_semantics.md`) with an accompanying Lean mechanization scaffold (`formal/lean/Asupersync.lean`).

One example: the cancellation/cleanup **budget** composes as a semiring-like object (componentwise `min`, with priority as `max`), which makes "who constrains whom?" algebraic instead of ad-hoc:

```text
combine(b1, b2) =
  deadline   := min(b1.deadline,   b2.deadline)
  pollQuota  := min(b1.pollQuota,  b2.pollQuota)
  costQuota  := min(b1.costQuota,  b2.costQuota)
  priority   := max(b1.priority,   b2.priority)
```

This is the kind of structure that lets us reason about cancellation protocols and bounded cleanup with proof-friendly, compositional rules.

### DPOR-Style Schedule Exploration (Mazurkiewicz Traces, Foata Fingerprints)

The Lab runtime includes a DPOR-style schedule explorer (`src/lab/explorer.rs`) that treats executions as traces modulo commutation of independent events (Mazurkiewicz equivalence). Instead of "run it 10,000 times and pray", it tracks coverage by equivalence class fingerprints and can prioritize exploration based on trace topology.

Result: deterministic, replayable concurrency debugging with *coverage semantics* rather than vibes.

### Anytime-Valid Invariant Monitoring via e-processes

Oracles can run repeatedly during an execution without invalidating significance, using **e-processes** (`src/lab/oracle/eprocess.rs`). The key property is Ville's inequality (anytime validity):

```text
P_H0(∃ t : E_t ≥ 1/α) ≤ α
```

So you can "peek" after every scheduling step and still control type-I error, which is exactly what you want in a deterministic scheduler + oracle setting.

### Distribution-Free Conformal Calibration for Lab Metrics

For lab metrics that benefit from calibrated prediction sets, Asupersync uses split conformal calibration (`src/lab/conformal.rs`) with finite-sample, distribution-free guarantees (under exchangeability):

```text
P(Y ∈ C(X)) ≥ 1 − α
```

This is used to keep alerting and invariant diagnostics robust without baking in fragile distributional assumptions.

### Explainable Evidence Ledgers (Bayes Factors, Galaxy-Brain Diagnostics)

When a run violates an invariant (or conspicuously does not), Asupersync can produce a structured evidence ledger (`src/lab/oracle/evidence.rs`) using Bayes factors and log-likelihood contributions. This enables agent-friendly debugging: equations, substitutions, and one-line intuitions, so you can see *exactly why* the system believes "task leak" (or "clean close") is happening.

### Deterministic Algorithms in the Hot Path (Not Just in Tests)

Determinism is treated as a first-class algorithmic constraint across the codebase:

- A deterministic virtual time wheel (`src/lab/virtual_time_wheel.rs`) with explicit tie-breaking.
- Deterministic consistent hashing (`src/distributed/consistent_hash.rs`) for stable assignment without iteration-order landmines.
- Trace canonicalization and race analysis hooks integrated into the lab runtime (`src/lab/runtime.rs`, `src/trace/dpor`).

"Same seed, same behavior" holds end-to-end, not just for a demo scheduler.

| Feature | Asupersync | async-std | smol |
|---------|------------|-----------|------|
| **Structured concurrency** | ✅ Enforced | ❌ Manual | ❌ Manual |
| **Cancel-correctness** | ✅ Protocol | ⚠️ Drop-based | ⚠️ Drop-based |
| **No orphan tasks** | ✅ Guaranteed | ❌ spawn detaches | ❌ spawn detaches |
| **Bounded cleanup** | ✅ Budgeted | ❌ Best-effort | ❌ Best-effort |
| **Deterministic testing** | ✅ Built-in | ❌ External tools | ❌ External tools |
| **Obligation tracking** | ✅ Linear tokens | ❌ None | ❌ None |
| **Ecosystem** | 🔜 Growing | ⚠️ Medium | ⚠️ Small |
| **Maturity** | 🔜 Active dev | ✅ Production | ✅ Production |

**When to use Asupersync:**
- Internal applications where correctness > ecosystem
- Systems where cancel-correctness is non-negotiable (financial, medical, infrastructure)
- Projects that need deterministic concurrency testing
- Distributed systems with structured shutdown requirements

**When to consider alternatives:**
- You need broad ecosystem library compatibility (we're building native equivalents)
- Rapid prototyping where correctness guarantees aren't yet critical

## Core Types Reference

### Outcome — Four-Valued Result

```rust
pub enum Outcome<T, E> {
    Ok(T),                    // Success
    Err(E),                   // Application error
    Cancelled(CancelReason),  // External cancellation
    Panicked(PanicPayload),   // Task panicked
}

// Severity lattice: Ok < Err < Cancelled < Panicked
// HTTP mapping: Ok→200, Err→4xx/5xx, Cancelled→499, Panicked→500
```

### Budget — Resource Constraints

```rust
pub struct Budget {
    pub deadline: Option<Time>,   // Absolute deadline
    pub poll_quota: u32,          // Max poll calls
    pub cost_quota: Option<u64>,  // Abstract cost units
    pub priority: u8,             // Scheduling priority (0-255)
}

// Semiring: meet(a, b) = tighter constraint wins
let effective = outer_budget.meet(inner_budget);
```

### CancelReason — Structured Context

```rust
pub enum CancelKind {
    User,             // Explicit cancellation
    Timeout,          // Deadline exceeded
    FailFast,         // Sibling failed
    RaceLost,         // Lost a race
    ParentCancelled,  // Parent region cancelled
    Shutdown,         // Runtime shutdown
}

// Severity: User < Timeout < FailFast < ParentCancelled < Shutdown
// Cleanup budgets scale inversely with severity
```

### Cx — Capability Context

```rust
pub struct Cx { /* ... */ }

impl Cx {
    pub fn spawn<F>(&self, f: F) -> TaskHandle;
    pub fn checkpoint(&self) -> Result<(), Cancelled>;
    pub fn mask(&self) -> MaskGuard;  // Defer cancellation
    pub fn trace(&self, event: TraceEvent);
    pub fn budget(&self) -> Budget;
    pub fn is_cancel_requested(&self) -> bool;
}
```

## Networking & Protocol Stack

Asupersync ships a cancel-safe networking stack from raw sockets through application protocols. Every layer participates in structured concurrency: reads and writes respect region budgets, cancellation drains connections cleanly, and the lab runtime can substitute virtual TCP for deterministic network testing.

### TCP

`src/net/tcp/` provides `TcpStream`, `TcpListener`, and split reader/writer halves. Connections are registered with the I/O reactor (epoll or io_uring) and use oneshot waker semantics: the reactor disarms interest after each readiness event, and the stream re-arms explicitly. This avoids spurious wakes at the cost of a `set_interest` call per poll cycle, which benchmarks show is negligible compared to syscall overhead.

A `VirtualTcp` implementation (`src/net/tcp/virtual_tcp.rs`) provides a fully in-memory TCP abstraction for lab-runtime tests. Same API surface, deterministic behavior, no kernel sockets.

### HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2

`src/http/h1/` implements HTTP/1.1 with chunked transfer encoding, connection keep-alive, and streaming request/response bodies. `src/http/h2/` implements HTTP/2 frame parsing, HPACK header compression, flow control, and stream multiplexing over a single connection.

Both layers integrate with connection pooling (`src/http/pool.rs`) and optional response compression (`src/http/compress.rs`).

### WebSocket

`src/net/websocket/` implements RFC 6455: handshake, binary/text frames, ping/pong, and close frames with status codes. The split reader/writer model allows concurrent send and receive within the same region.

### TLS

`src/tls/` wraps `rustls` for TLS 1.2/1.3 with three feature flags:

| Flag | Root Certs |
|------|------------|
| `tls` | Bring your own |
| `tls-native-roots` | OS trust store |
| `tls-webpki-roots` | Mozilla's WebPKI bundle |

### DNS and UDP

`src/net/dns/` provides async DNS resolution with address-family selection. `src/net/udp.rs` provides async UDP sockets with send/receive and cancellation safety.

---

## Database Integration

Asupersync includes async clients for three databases, each respecting structured concurrency and cancellation.

| Database | Location | Wire Protocol | Auth |
|----------|----------|---------------|------|
| **SQLite** | `src/database/sqlite.rs` | Blocking pool bridge | N/A |
| **PostgreSQL** | `src/database/postgres.rs` | Binary protocol v3 | SCRAM-SHA-256 |
| **MySQL** | `src/database/mysql.rs` | MySQL wire protocol | Native + caching_sha2 |

All three support prepared statements, transactions, and connection reuse. SQLite operations run on the blocking thread pool (since `rusqlite` is synchronous) with cancel-safe wrappers that respect region deadlines. PostgreSQL and MySQL implement their wire protocols directly over `TcpStream`, avoiding external driver dependencies.

---

## Channels and Synchronization Primitives

### Channels

| Channel | Location | Pattern | Cancel-Safe |
|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **MPSC** | `src/channel/mpsc.rs` | Multi-producer, single-consumer | Two-phase send (reserve/commit) |
| **Oneshot** | `src/channel/oneshot.rs` | Single send, single receive | Two-phase send |
| **Broadcast** | `src/channel/broadcast.rs` | Fan-out to subscribers | Waiter cleanup on drop |
| **Watch** | `src/channel/watch.rs` | Last-value multicast | Always-current read |
| **Session** | `src/channel/session.rs` | Typed RPC with reply obligation | Reply is a linear resource |

The two-phase pattern (reserve a permit, then commit the send) is central to cancel-correctness. A reserved-but-uncommitted permit aborts cleanly on cancellation. A committed send is guaranteed delivered. No half-sent messages.

### Synchronization

| Primitive | Location | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Mutex** | `src/sync/mutex.rs` | Fair, cancel-safe, tracks contention |
| **RwLock** | `src/sync/rwlock.rs` | Writer preference with reader batching |
| **Semaphore** | `src/sync/semaphore.rs` | Counting, with permit-as-obligation model |
| **Barrier** | `src/sync/barrier.rs` | N-way synchronization point |
| **Notify** | `src/sync/notify.rs` | One-time or multi-waiter notification |
| **OnceLock** | `src/sync/once_cell.rs` | Async one-time initialization |
| **ContendedMutex** | `src/sync/contended_mutex.rs` | Mutex with contention metrics |
| **Pool** | `src/sync/pool.rs` | Object pool with per-thread caches |

All primitives are deterministic under the lab runtime and participate in futurelock detection.

---

## Concurrency Combinators

Beyond `join`, `race`, and `timeout`, the combinator library includes patterns for distributed systems and resilience:

| Combinator | Location | Purpose |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **quorum** | `src/combinator/quorum.rs` | M-of-N completion for consensus patterns |
| **hedge** | `src/combinator/hedge.rs` | Start backup after delay, first response wins |
| **first_ok** | `src/combinator/first_ok.rs` | Try operations sequentially until one succeeds |
| **pipeline** | `src/combinator/pipeline.rs` | Staged transformations with backpressure |
| **map_reduce** | `src/combinator/map_reduce.rs` | Parallel map + monoid reduction |
| **circuit_breaker** | `src/combinator/circuit_breaker.rs` | Failure detection, open/half-open/closed states |
| **bulkhead** | `src/combinator/bulkhead.rs` | Concurrency isolation (bounded parallelism) |
| **rate_limit** | `src/combinator/rate_limit.rs` | Token bucket throughput control |
| **bracket** | `src/combinator/bracket.rs` | Acquire/use/release with guaranteed cleanup |
| **retry** | `src/combinator/retry.rs` | Exponential backoff, budget-aware |

Every combinator is cancel-safe. Losers drain after races. Outcomes aggregate via the severity lattice. An explicit law sheet (`src/combinator/laws.rs`) documents algebraic properties (associativity, commutativity, distributivity) and a rewrite engine (`src/plan/rewrite.rs`) can optimize combinator DAGs while preserving cancel/drain/quiescence invariants.

## RaptorQ Fountain Coding

`src/raptorq/` implements RFC 6330 systematic RaptorQ codes, a fountain code where any K-of-N encoded symbols suffice to recover the original K source symbols. This underpins Asupersync's distributed snapshot distribution: region state is encoded, symbols are assigned to replicas via consistent hashing, and recovery requires collecting a quorum of symbols from surviving nodes.

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `rfc6330.rs` | Standard-compliant parameter computation |
| `systematic.rs` | Systematic encoder/decoder |
| `gf256.rs` | GF(2^8) arithmetic (addition, multiplication, inversion) |
| `linalg.rs` | Matrix operations over GF(256) |
| `pipeline.rs` | Full sender/receiver pipelines with symbol authentication |
| `proof.rs` | Decode proof system for verifiable recovery |

The implementation is deterministic (no randomness in lab mode) and integrates with the security layer (`src/security/`) for per-symbol authentication tags, preventing Byzantine symbol injection.

---

## Stream Combinators

`src/stream/` provides a composable stream library with the standard functional operators: `map`, `filter`, `take`, `skip`, `chunks`, `chain`, `merge`, `zip`, `fold`, `for_each`, `inspect`, `enumerate`, `any_all`, `count`, `fuse`, `buffered`, and `try_stream`. Streams integrate with channels (`broadcast_stream`, `receiver_stream`) and participate in cancellation; a dropped stream cleanly aborts any pending I/O.

---

## Observability

### Structured Logging

`src/observability/entry.rs` defines `LogEntry` with span IDs, task IDs, region context, and structured fields. Log levels (Trace through Error) are separate from cancellation severity. The `LogCollector` batches entries for export.

### Metrics

`src/observability/metrics.rs` provides Counter, Gauge, and Histogram abstractions with a zero-allocation hot path. Optional OpenTelemetry integration (`src/observability/otel.rs`) exports to any OTLP-compatible backend. Multiple exporters (stdout, in-memory for tests, null for benchmarks) can compose via `MultiExporter`.

### Task Inspector and Diagnostics

`src/observability/task_inspector.rs` introspects live task state: blocked reasons, obligation holdings, budget usage, and cancellation status. `src/observability/diagnostics.rs` produces structured explanations: `CancellationExplanation` traces the full cancel propagation chain, `TaskBlockedExplanation` identifies what a task is waiting on, and `ObligationLeak` pinpoints which obligation was not resolved and by whom.

---

## Proc Macros

`asupersync-macros/` provides proc macros for ergonomic structured concurrency:

```rust
scope! {
    let a = spawn!(worker_a);
    let b = spawn!(worker_b);
    join!(a, b)
}

let winner = race!(task_a, task_b);
```

The macros expand to standard Scope/Cx calls with proper region ownership. Compile-fail tests (via `trybuild`) verify that incorrect usage produces clear error messages. See `docs/macro-dsl.md` for the full pattern catalog.

---

## Conformance Suite

`conformance/` is a standalone crate containing runtime-agnostic correctness tests. It verifies:

- **Budget enforcement**: deadlines and poll quotas are respected
- **Channel invariants**: two-phase sends, bounded capacity, waiter cleanup
- **I/O correctness**: read/write under cancellation
- **Outcome aggregation**: severity lattice composition
- **Runtime invariants**: no orphans, region quiescence
- **Negative tests**: fault injection scenarios (obligation leaks, region hangs)

Tests emit deterministic artifact bundles (`event_log.txt`, `failed_assertions.json`, `repro_manifest.json`) when `ASUPERSYNC_TEST_ARTIFACTS_DIR` is set, making CI failures reproducible with a single manifest file.

---

## Spork (OTP Mental Model)

Spork is an OTP-style layer built on Asupersync's kernel guarantees: regions
(structured concurrency), obligations (linearity), explicit cancellation, and the
deterministic lab runtime.

### OTP Mapping (Conceptual)

| OTP Concept | Spork / Asupersync Interpretation |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Process | A region-owned task/actor (cannot orphan) |
| Supervisor | A compiled, deterministic restart topology over regions |
| Link | Failure propagation rule (sibling/parent coupling; deterministic) |
| Monitor + DOWN | Observation without coupling: deterministic notifications |
| Registry | Names as lease obligations: reserve/commit or abort (no stale names) |
| call/cast | Request/response and mailbox protocols with bounded drain on cancel |

### Why Spork Is Strictly Stronger (When We Finish It)

- Determinism: the lab runtime makes OTP-style debugging reproducible (seeded schedules, trace capture/replay, schedule exploration).
- Cancel-correctness: cancellation is a protocol (request -> drain -> finalize), so OTP-style shutdown has explicit budgets and bounded cleanup.
- No silent leaks: regions cannot close with live children or unresolved obligations (permits/acks/leases), so "forgot to reply" and "stale name" become structural failures (or test-oracle failures), not production mysteries.

### Where To Look In The Repo

- Supervisor compilation/runtime: `src/supervision.rs`
- Name leases + registry plumbing: `src/cx/registry.rs`
- Minimal supervised Spork app walkthrough: `examples/spork_minimal_supervised_app.rs`
- Deterministic ordering contracts (Spork): `docs/spork_deterministic_ordering.md`
- Spork glossary + invariants: `docs/spork_glossary_invariants.md`
- Crash artifacts + canonical traces: `src/trace/crashpack.rs`

## Mathematical Foundations

Asupersync has formal semantics backing its engineering.

| Concept | Math | Payoff |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Outcomes** | Severity lattice: `Ok < Err < Cancelled < Panicked` | Monotone aggregation, no "recovery" from worse states |
| **Concurrency** | Near-semiring: `join (⊗)` and `race (⊕)` with laws | Lawful rewrites, DAG optimization |
| **Budgets** | Tropical semiring: `(ℝ∪{∞}, min, +)` | Critical path computation, budget propagation |
| **Obligations** | Linear logic: resources used exactly once | No leaks, static checking possible |
| **Traces** | Mazurkiewicz equivalence (partial orders) | Optimal DPOR, stable replay |
| **Cancellation** | Two-player game with budgets | Completeness theorem: sufficient budgets guarantee termination |

See [`asupersync_v4_formal_semantics.md`](./asupersync_v4_formal_semantics.md) for the complete operational semantics.

## "Alien Artifact" Quality Algorithms

Asupersync is intentionally "math-forward": it uses advanced math and theory-grade CS where it buys real guarantees (determinism, cancel-correctness, bounded cleanup, and reproducible concurrency debugging). This is not aspirational; the mechanisms below are implemented in the codebase today.

### Mazurkiewicz Trace Monoid + Foata Normal Form (DPOR Equivalence Classes)

Instead of treating traces as opaque linear logs, Asupersync factors out *pure commutations* of independent events via trace theory. Two traces that differ only by swapping adjacent independent events are considered equivalent, and canonicalized to a unique representative (Foata normal form). See `src/trace/canonicalize.rs`.

$$
M(\\Sigma, I) = \\Sigma^* / \\equiv_I
$$

Payoff: canonical fingerprints for schedule exploration and stable replay across "same behavior, different interleaving" runs.

### Geodesic Schedule Normalization (A* / Beam Search Over Linear Extensions)

Given a dependency DAG (trace poset), Asupersync constructs a valid linear extension that minimizes "owner switches" (a proxy for context-switch entropy) using deterministic heuristics and an exact bounded A* solver. See `src/trace/geodesic.rs` and `src/trace/event_structure.rs`.

Payoff: smaller, more canonical traces that are easier to diff, replay, and minimize.

### DPOR Race Detection + Happens-Before (Vector Clocks)

Asupersync includes DPOR-style race detection and backtracking point extraction, using a minimal happens-before relation (vector clocks per task) plus resource-footprint conflicts. See `src/trace/dpor.rs` and `src/trace/independence.rs`.

Payoff: systematic interleaving exploration that targets truly different behaviors instead of brute-force schedule fuzzing.

### Persistent Homology of Trace Commutation Complexes (GF(2) Boundary Reduction)

Schedule exploration is prioritized using topological signals from a square cell complex built out of commuting diamonds: edges are causality edges, squares represent valid commutations, and Betti numbers/persistence quantify "non-trivial scheduling freedom". The implementation uses deterministic GF(2) bitset linear algebra and boundary-matrix reduction. See `src/trace/boundary.rs`, `src/trace/gf2.rs`, and `src/trace/scoring.rs`.

Payoff: an evidence-ledger, structure-aware notion of "interesting schedules" that tends to surface rare concurrency behaviors earlier.

### Sheaf-Theoretic Consistency Checks for Distributed Sagas

In distributed obligation tracking, pairwise lattice merges can hide *global* inconsistency (phantom commits). Asupersync models this as a sheaf-style gluing problem and detects obstructions where no global assignment explains all local observations. See `src/trace/distributed/sheaf.rs`.

Payoff: catches split-brain-style saga states that evade purely pairwise conflict checks.

### Anytime-Valid Invariant Monitoring (E-Processes, Ville's Inequality)

The lab runtime can continuously monitor invariants (task leaks, obligation leaks, region quiescence) using e-processes: a supermartingale-based, anytime-valid testing framework that supports optional stopping without "peeking penalties". See `src/lab/oracle/eprocess.rs` and `src/obligation/eprocess.rs`.

Payoff: turn long-running exploration into statistically sound monitoring, with deterministic, explainable rejection thresholds.

### Distribution-Free Conformal Calibration for Oracle Metrics

Oracle anomaly thresholds are calibrated using split conformal prediction, giving finite-sample, distribution-free coverage guarantees under exchangeability assumptions across deterministic schedule seeds. See `src/lab/conformal.rs`.

Payoff: stable false-alarm behavior under workload drift, without hand-tuned magic constants.

### Algebraic Law Sheets + Rewrite Engines With Side-Condition Lattices

Asupersync's concurrency combinators come with an explicit law sheet (severity lattices, budget semirings, race/join laws, etc.) and a rewrite engine guarded by conservative static analyses (obligation-safety and cancel-safety lattices; deadline min-plus reasoning). See `src/combinator/laws.rs`, `src/plan/rewrite.rs`, and `src/plan/analysis.rs`.

Payoff: principled plan optimization without silently breaking cancel/drain/quiescence invariants.

### TLA+ Export for Model Checking

Traces can be exported as TLA+ behaviors with spec skeletons for bounded TLC model checking of core invariants (no orphans, obligation linearity, quiescence). See `src/trace/tla_export.rs`.

Payoff: bridge from deterministic runtime traces to model-checking workflows when you need "prove it", not "it passed tests".

### Semver Policy

- **0.x.y**: Breaking changes may ship in **0.(x+1).0**
- **1.x.y**: Breaking changes only in **(1+1).0.0**

See `docs/api_audit.md` for the current public API audit and stability notes.

### Core Exports

```rust
use asupersync::{
    // Capability context
    Cx, Scope,

    // Outcome types (four-valued result)
    Outcome, OutcomeError, PanicPayload, Severity, join_outcomes,

    // Cancellation
    CancelKind, CancelReason,

    // Resource management
    Budget, Time,

    // Error handling
    Error, ErrorKind, Recoverability,

    // Identifiers
    RegionId, TaskId, ObligationId,

    // Testing
    LabConfig, LabRuntime,

    // Policy
    Policy,
};
```

### Wrapping Cx for Frameworks

Framework authors (e.g., HTTP servers) should wrap `Cx`:

```rust
/// Framework-specific request context
pub struct RequestContext<'a> {
    cx: &'a Cx,
    request_id: u64,
}

impl<'a> RequestContext<'a> {
    pub fn is_cancelled(&self) -> bool {
        self.cx.is_cancel_requested()
    }

    pub fn budget(&self) -> Budget {
        self.cx.budget()
    }

    pub fn checkpoint(&self) -> Result<(), asupersync::Error> {
        self.cx.checkpoint()
    }
}
```

### HTTP Status Mapping

```rust
// Recommended HTTP status mapping:
// - Outcome::Ok(_)        → 200 OK
// - Outcome::Err(_)       → 4xx/5xx based on error type
// - Outcome::Cancelled(_) → 499 Client Closed Request
// - Outcome::Panicked(_)  → 500 Internal Server Error
```

---

## Configuration

### Lab Runtime Configuration

```rust
let config = LabConfig::default()
    // Seed for deterministic scheduling (same seed = same execution)
    .seed(42)

    // Maximum steps before timeout (prevents infinite loops)
    .max_steps(100_000)

    // Enable futurelock detection (tasks holding obligations without progress)
    .futurelock_max_idle_steps(1000)

    // Enable trace capture for replay
    .capture_trace(true);

let lab = LabRuntime::new(config);
```

### Budget Configuration

```rust
// Request timeout with poll budget
let request_budget = Budget::new()
    .with_deadline_secs(30)       // 30 second timeout
    .with_poll_quota(10_000)      // Max 10k polls
    .with_priority(100);          // Normal priority

// Cleanup budget (tighter for faster shutdown)
let cleanup_budget = Budget::new()
    .with_deadline_secs(5)
    .with_poll_quota(500);
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "ObligationLeak detected"

Your task completed while holding an obligation (permit, ack, lease).

```rust
// Wrong: permit dropped without send/abort
let permit = tx.reserve(cx).await?;
return Outcome::ok(());  // Leak!

// Right: always resolve obligations
let permit = tx.reserve(cx).await?;
permit.send(message);  // Resolved
```

### "RegionCloseTimeout"

A region is stuck waiting for children that won't complete.

```rust
// Check for: infinite loops without checkpoints
loop {
    cx.checkpoint()?;  // Add checkpoints in loops
    // ... work ...
}
```

### "FuturelockViolation"

A task is holding obligations but not making progress.

```rust
// Check for: awaiting something that will never resolve
// while holding a permit/lock
let permit = tx.reserve(cx).await?;
other_thing.await;  // If this blocks forever → futurelock
permit.send(msg);
```

### Deterministic test failures

Same seed should give same execution. If not:

```rust
// Check for: time-based operations
// WRONG: uses wall-clock time
let now = std::time::Instant::now();

// RIGHT: uses virtual time through Cx
let now = cx.now();
```

Also check for ambient randomness:

```rust
// WRONG: ambient entropy breaks determinism
let id = rand::random::<u64>();

// RIGHT: use capability-based entropy
let id = cx.random_u64();
```

To enforce deterministic collections in lab code, consider a clippy rule that
disallows `std::collections::HashMap/HashSet` in favor of `util::DetHashMap/DetHashSet`.

### What Asupersync Doesn't Do

- **Cooperative cancellation only**: Non-cooperative code requires explicit escalation boundaries
- **Not a drop-in replacement for other runtimes**: Different API, different guarantees
- **No ecosystem compatibility**: Can't directly use runtime-specific libraries (adapters planned)

### Design Trade-offs

| Choice | Trade-off |
|--------|-----------|
| Explicit checkpoints | More verbose, but cancellation is observable |
| Capability tokens | Extra parameter threading, but testable and auditable |
| Two-phase effects | More complex primitives, but no data loss |
| Region ownership | Can't detach tasks, but no orphans |

## FAQ

### Why "Asupersync"?

"A super sync": structured concurrency done right.

### Why not just use existing runtimes with careful conventions?

Conventions don't compose. The 100th engineer on your team will spawn a detached task. The library you depend on will drop a future holding a lock. Asupersync makes incorrect code unrepresentable (or at least detectable).

### How does this compare to structured concurrency in other languages?

Similar goals to Kotlin coroutines, Swift structured concurrency, and Java's Project Loom. Asupersync goes further with:
- Formal operational semantics
- Two-phase effects for cancel-safety
- Obligation tracking (linear resources)
- Deterministic lab runtime

### Can I use this with existing async Rust code?

Asupersync has its own runtime with explicit capabilities. For code that needs to interop with external async libraries, we provide boundary adapters that preserve our cancel-correctness guarantees.

### Is this production-ready?

Phases 0 through 3 are complete: deterministic kernel, parallel scheduler, full I/O stack (TCP/HTTP/TLS/WebSocket), database clients, and OTP-style actors with supervision. Phase 4 (distributed structured concurrency) is in progress. Use for internal applications where correctness matters more than ecosystem breadth.

## Contributing

> *About Contributions:* Please don't take this the wrong way, but I do not accept outside contributions for any of my projects. I simply don't have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the thing, so I'm responsible for any problems it causes; thus, the risk-reward is highly asymmetric from my perspective. I'd also have to worry about other "stakeholders," which seems unwise for tools I mostly make for myself for free. Feel free to submit issues, and even PRs if you want to illustrate a proposed fix, but know I won't merge them directly. Instead, I'll have Claude or Codex review submissions via `gh` and independently decide whether and how to address them. Bug reports in particular are welcome. Sorry if this offends, but I want to avoid wasted time and hurt feelings. I understand this isn't in sync with the prevailing open-source ethos that seeks community contributions, but it's the only way I can move at this velocity and keep my sanity.
