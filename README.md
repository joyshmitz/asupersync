## TL;DR

**The Problem**: Rust's async ecosystem (tokio, async-std) gives you *tools* but not *guarantees*. Cancellation silently drops data. Spawned tasks can orphan. Cleanup is best-effort. Testing concurrent code is non-deterministic. You write correct code by convention, and discover bugs in production.

**The Solution**: Asupersync is an async runtime where **correctness is structural, not conventional**. Tasks are owned by regions that close to quiescence. Cancellation is a protocol with bounded cleanup. Effects require capabilities. The lab runtime makes concurrency deterministic and replayable.

### Why Asupersync?

| Guarantee | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **No orphan tasks** | Every spawned task is owned by a region; region close waits for all children |
| **Cancel-correctness** | Cancellation is request → drain → finalize, never silent data loss |
| **Bounded cleanup** | Cleanup budgets are *sufficient conditions*, not hopes |
| **No silent drops** | Two-phase effects (reserve/commit) make data loss impossible for primitives |
| **Deterministic testing** | Lab runtime: virtual time, deterministic scheduling, trace replay |
| **Capability security** | All effects flow through explicit `Cx`; no ambient authority |

---

## The Core Idea

Most async runtimes are "spawn and pray":

```rust
// Tokio: what happens when this scope exits?
tokio::spawn(async { /* orphaned? cancelled? who knows */ });
```

Asupersync enforces structured concurrency:

```rust
// Asupersync: scope guarantees quiescence
scope.region(|sub| async {
    sub.spawn(task_a);
    sub.spawn(task_b);
    // ← region close: waits for BOTH tasks, runs finalizers, resolves obligations
}).await;
// ← guaranteed: nothing from inside is still running
```

**Cancellation works as a protocol, not a flag:**

```
Running → CancelRequested → Cancelling → Finalizing → Completed(Cancelled)
            ↓                    ↓             ↓
         (bounded)          (cleanup)    (finalizers)
```

Every step is explicit, budgeted, and driven to completion.

---

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Structured Concurrency by Construction

Tasks don't float free. Every task is owned by a region. Regions form a tree. When a region closes, it *guarantees* all children are complete, all finalizers have run, all obligations are resolved. This is the "no orphans" invariant, enforced by the type system and runtime rather than by discipline.

### 2. Cancellation as a First-Class Protocol

Cancellation operates as a multi-phase protocol, not a silent `drop`:
- **Request**: propagates down the tree
- **Drain**: tasks run to cleanup points (bounded by budgets)
- **Finalize**: finalizers run (masked, budgeted)
- **Complete**: outcome is `Cancelled(reason)`

Primitives publish *cancellation responsiveness bounds*. Budgets are sufficient conditions for completion.

### 3. Two-Phase Effects Prevent Data Loss

Anywhere cancellation could lose data, Asupersync uses reserve/commit:

```rust
let permit = tx.reserve(cx).await?;  // ← cancel-safe: nothing committed yet
permit.send(message);                 // ← linear: must happen or abort
```

Dropping a permit aborts cleanly. Message never partially sent.

### 4. Capability Security (No Ambient Authority)

All effects flow through explicit capability tokens:

```rust
async fn my_task(cx: &mut Cx<'_>) {
    cx.spawn(...);        // ← need spawn capability
    cx.sleep_until(...);  // ← need time capability
    cx.trace(...);        // ← need trace capability
}
```

Swap `Cx` to change interpretation: production vs. lab vs. distributed.

### 5. Deterministic Testing is Default

The lab runtime provides:
- **Virtual time**: sleeps complete instantly, time is controlled
- **Deterministic scheduling**: same seed → same execution
- **Trace capture/replay**: debug production issues locally
- **Schedule exploration**: DPOR-class coverage of interleavings

Concurrency bugs become reproducible test failures.

## How Asupersync Compares

| Feature | Asupersync | tokio | async-std | smol |
|---------|------------|-------|-----------|------|
| **Structured concurrency** | ✅ Enforced | ❌ Manual | ❌ Manual | ❌ Manual |
| **Cancel-correctness** | ✅ Protocol | ⚠️ Drop-based | ⚠️ Drop-based | ⚠️ Drop-based |
| **No orphan tasks** | ✅ Guaranteed | ❌ spawn detaches | ❌ spawn detaches | ❌ spawn detaches |
| **Bounded cleanup** | ✅ Budgeted | ❌ Best-effort | ❌ Best-effort | ❌ Best-effort |
| **Deterministic testing** | ✅ Built-in | ❌ External tools | ❌ External tools | ❌ External tools |
| **Obligation tracking** | ✅ Linear tokens | ❌ None | ❌ None | ❌ None |
| **Ecosystem** | ❌ New | ✅ Massive | ⚠️ Medium | ⚠️ Small |
| **Maturity** | ❌ Design phase | ✅ Production | ✅ Production | ✅ Production |

**When to use Asupersync:**
- Internal applications where correctness > ecosystem
- Systems where cancel-correctness is non-negotiable (financial, medical, infrastructure)
- Projects that need deterministic concurrency testing
- Distributed systems with structured shutdown requirements

**When Asupersync might not be ideal:**
- You need tokio ecosystem compatibility today
- Rapid prototyping where guarantees don't matter yet
- Projects that can't wait for implementation

## Mathematical Foundations

Asupersync has formal semantics backing its engineering.

| Concept | Math | Payoff |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Outcomes** | Severity lattice: `Ok < Err < Cancelled < Panicked` | Monotone aggregation, no "recovery" from worse states |
| **Concurrency** | Near-semiring: `join (⊗)` and `race (⊕)` with laws | Lawful rewrites, DAG optimization |
| **Budgets** | Tropical semiring: `(ℝ∪{∞}, min, +)` | Critical path computation, budget propagation |
| **Obligations** | Linear logic: resources used exactly once | No leaks, static checking possible |
| **Traces** | Mazurkiewicz equivalence (partial orders) | Optimal DPOR, stable replay |
| **Cancellation** | Two-player game with budgets | Completeness theorem: sufficient budgets guarantee termination |

See [`asupersync_v4_formal_semantics.md`](./asupersync_v4_formal_semantics.md) for the complete operational semantics.

### Mathematical Backbone (Ultra-Deep)

For those who care about the deepest foundations, the design is also compatible with:
- **Event structures + higher-dimensional automata** for true concurrency (cancellation as conflict, schedules as d-paths).
- **Quantitative/graded types** for budgets and obligations (compile-time resource bounds, not just runtime checks).
- **Concurrent/quantitative game semantics** for cancellation (bounded cleanup as a winning strategy).
- **Min-plus network calculus** for buffer sizing and latency bounds (arrival/service curves).
- **Sheaf-theoretic consistency** for distributed sagas (cohomological obstruction to commit).

These are part of the design contract. They do not change the everyday API, but they sharpen
proofs, testing oracles, and optimizer laws.

## Limitations

### Current State: Design Phase

Asupersync is currently a **specification**, not an implementation. The design documents are complete; code does not yet exist.

### Honest Trade-offs

| Limitation | Why It Exists | Mitigation |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| **No ecosystem** | New runtime, incompatible with tokio | Internal use cases don't need ecosystem |
| **Ergonomics tax** | Explicit capabilities, two-phase patterns | Macros can reduce boilerplate |
| **Learning curve** | New mental model (regions, obligations) | Comprehensive documentation |
| **Performance unknown** | No implementation to benchmark | Design prioritizes correctness; optimize later |

### What Asupersync Does NOT Do

- **Magically cancel arbitrary futures**: Non-cooperative futures can still stall; escalation boundaries are explicit
- **Exactly-once distributed execution**: We provide *idempotency + leases*; exactly-once is a system property
- **Compiler-level guarantees**: No language changes; relies on runtime + conventions

---

## FAQ

### Why "Asupersync"?

"A super sync": structured concurrency done right.

### Why not just use tokio with careful conventions?

Conventions don't compose. The 100th engineer on your team will spawn a detached task. The library you depend on will drop a future holding a lock. Asupersync makes incorrect code unrepresentable (or at least detectable).

### Is this vaporware?

The specification is complete and detailed enough to implement. Implementation is the next phase. The design has been refined through multiple iterations with formal semantics.

### How does this compare to structured concurrency in other languages?

Similar goals to Kotlin coroutines, Swift structured concurrency, and Java's Project Loom. Asupersync goes further with:
- Formal operational semantics
- Two-phase effects for cancel-safety
- Obligation tracking (linear resources)
- Deterministic lab runtime

### Can I use this with existing async Rust code?

Not directly. Asupersync is a new runtime with its own `Future` polling and capability system. Interop would require adapters at the boundary.

### When will it be usable?

Phase 0 (single-thread kernel) is the next milestone. No timeline; this is a correctness-first project.

## Contributing

> *About Contributions:* Please don't take this the wrong way, but I do not accept outside contributions for any of my projects. I simply don't have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the thing, so I'm responsible for any problems it causes; thus, the risk-reward is highly asymmetric from my perspective. I'd also have to worry about other "stakeholders," which seems unwise for tools I mostly make for myself for free. Feel free to submit issues, and even PRs if you want to illustrate a proposed fix, but know I won't merge them directly. Instead, I'll have Claude or Codex review submissions via `gh` and independently decide whether and how to address them. Bug reports in particular are welcome. Sorry if this offends, but I want to avoid wasted time and hurt feelings. I understand this isn't in sync with the prevailing open-source ethos that seeks community contributions, but it's the only way I can move at this velocity and keep my sanity.
