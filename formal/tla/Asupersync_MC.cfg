\* TLC model checker configuration for Asupersync (bd-11g3i)
\*
\* Bounded configuration: 2 tasks, 2 regions, 1 obligation, mask depth 2.
\* This is the smallest interesting configuration that exercises:
\*   - Nested regions (parent/child)
\*   - Multiple tasks with cancel interleaving
\*   - Obligation lifecycle
\*
\* Larger configurations (3 tasks, 3 regions) require more workers/time.
